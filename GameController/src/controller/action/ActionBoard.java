 * <p>
 * This class actually holds static every instance of an action to get these
 * actions where ever you want to execute or identify them.
 * It may be usefull to have instances of actions that are not listed here,
 * that would be ok but for basic features it should not be needed.
 * Because of multi-thredding you should not take actions from here to write
 * into their attributes. However, you should allways avoid writing in
 * action`s attributes except in their constructor.
 * <p>
 * You can read a detailed description of each action in it`s class.
